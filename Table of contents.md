### What you need to know about this book
This book is about ECMAScript 6 (whose official name is ECMAScript 2015), a new version of JavaScript.  

本书主要介绍ECMAScript 6(官方称为ECMAScript 2015)是JavaScript的新版本  

### Audience: JavaScript programmers
In order to understand this book, you should already know JavaScript. If you don’t: my other book [“Speaking JavaScript”][http://speakingjs.com/] is free online and teaches programmers all of JavaScript (up to and including ECMAScript 5).  

为了更好学习本书，您最好是具有JavaScript基础。如果你还不具备JavaScript基础，可以先读我的《Speaking JavaScript》这本书--学习javascript基础知识并包含ECMAScript 5。  

### Why should I read this book?

* **You decide how deep to go:** This book covers ECMAScript 6 in depth, but is structured so that you can also quickly get an overview if you want to.  


* **Not just “what”, also “why”:** This book not only tells you how ES6 works, it also tells you why it works the way it does.  

* **Thoroughly researched:**  In order to make sense of ES6, I have consulted many sources:  

  * The language specification (to which you’ll occasionally find pointers in this book)
  * The es-discuss mailing list
  * The TC39 meeting notes
  * Scientific papers
  * Documentation on features in other languages that inspired ES6 features
  * And more
