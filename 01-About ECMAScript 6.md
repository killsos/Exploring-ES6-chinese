It took a long time to finish it, but ECMAScript 6, the next version of JavaScript, is finally a reality:

[It became a standard on 17 June 2015.](http://www.ecma-international.org/news/Publication%20of%20ECMA-262%206th%20edition.htm)
Most of its features are already widely available (as documented in [kangax’ ES6 compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)).
Transpilers (such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) let you compile ES6 to ES5.
The next sections explain concepts that are important in the world of ES6.

2015年6月17完成ES6 绝大部分特色已经可以使用（kangax’ ES6兼容列表） 通过babel将ES6代码转化为ES5
